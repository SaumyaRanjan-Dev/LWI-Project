# Python Menu-Driven Script for AWS Cloud Tasks

## Overview
This Python script provides a menu-driven interface to perform various AWS cloud tasks. The available options include launching EC2 instances, setting up RHEL GUI, accessing logs, creating event-driven architectures, connecting Python to MongoDB using Lambda, uploading objects to S3, and integrating Lambda with S3 and SES.

## How the Script Works

### Menu
The script displays a menu with the following options:

1. **Launch EC2 Instance**
   - Launches an EC2 instance using a specified AMI.

2. **Setup RHEL GUI Instance**
   - Placeholder for launching an EC2 instance with RHEL and setting up a GUI.

3. **Access Cloud Logs**
   - Lists available CloudWatch log groups.

4. **Create Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Placeholder for creating an architecture where an audio file upload triggers AWS Transcribe.

5. **Connect Python to MongoDB using Lambda**
   - Placeholder for connecting a Lambda function to MongoDB.

6. **Upload Object to S3**
   - Uploads a specified file to an S3 bucket.

7. **Integrate Lambda with S3 and SES**
   - Placeholder for integrating Lambda with S3 and SES to send emails.

8. **Exit**
   - Exits the script.

## Usage
To use the script, select the desired option from the menu and follow the prompts. Each option will execute the corresponding AWS task or provide instructions for the placeholder tasks.

**Note:** This script assumes that you have the necessary AWS credentials and permissions to perform the operations. Ensure that you have configured your AWS CLI with appropriate credentials before running the script.
